ALWAYS REMEMBER US THIS WAY
SONG BY LADY GAGA
LYRICS
THAT ARIZONA SKY BURNING IN YOUR EYES
YOU LOOK AT ME AND, BABE, I WANNA CATCH ON FIRE
It is BURIED IN MY SOUL LIKE CALIFORNIA GOLD
YOU FOUND THE LIGHT IN ME THAT I could not FIND
SO WHEN I am ALL CHOKED UP
AND I can not FIND THE WORDS
EVERY TIME WE SAY GOODBYE
BABY, IT HURTS
WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN
AND THE BAND will not PLAY
I will ALWAYS REMEMBER US THIS WAY
LOVERS IN THE NIGHT
POETS TRYING TO WRITE
WE do not KNOW HOW TO RHYME
BUT, DAMN, WE TRY
BUT ALL I REALLY KNOW
You are WHERE I WANNA GO
THE PART OF ME that is YOU WILL NEVER DIE
SO WHEN I am ALL CHOKED UP
AND I can not FIND THE WORDS
EVERY TIME WE SAY GOODBYE
BABY, IT HURTS
WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN
AND THE BAND will not PLAY
I will ALWAYS REMEMBER US THIS WAY
OH, YEAH
I do not WANNA BE JUST A MEMORY, BABY, YEAH
HOO, HOO, HOO
SO WHEN I am ALL CHOKED UP
AND I can not FIND THE WORDS
EVERY TIME WE SAY GOODBYE
BABY, IT HURTS
WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN
AND THE BAND will not PLAY
I will ALWAYS REMEMBER US THIS WAY, WAY, YEAH
WHEN YOU LOOK AT ME
AND THE WHOLE WORLD FADES
I will ALWAYS REMEMBER US THIS WAY
